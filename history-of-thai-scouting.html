      <h2>Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        Thai Scouting was established on <strong>July 1, 1911</strong> by 
        <strong>King Rama VI (King Vajiravudh)</strong>. Inspired by Lord 
        Baden-Powell, he founded Scouting to instill discipline, loyalty, 
        and civic responsibility in young people.

        The first Scout troops began in Bangkok schools and quickly spread 
        across the nation. By the 1920s, Scouting had become an integral part 
        of Thai education and youth development.

        Thai Scouts supported communities during national ceremonies, natural
